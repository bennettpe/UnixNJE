NJE for *nix
=============



This NJE repo is is the third incarnation of the Hebrew University of Jersualem NJE protocol for UNIX and VMS. The original VMS repo is here: https://github.com/moshix/HUJInje

In this new version, it's been made to compile cleanly on Linux, BSD (including latest Macos!), as well as with the latest gcc and glibc systems present in Ubuntu 22.04 [thanks wschaub!]

You will need to ask to peer with somebody on HNET to use this protocol. Contact me if you have a 24/7 Linux server and you want to peer with my HNET main node RELAY (which is also based on UNIXNJE). See more: www.moshix.tech 

UnixNJE is fully compatible with the NJE protocol and connects effortlessly to VM/SP or z/VM RSCS, NJE38 for MVS 3.8, SineNomine NJE, JNET for openVMS, NJE for Windows.

then type "make" and watch it compile

Running It
